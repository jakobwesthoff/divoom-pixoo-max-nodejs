# Divoom Pixoo-Max Hack

The code in this repository was created while trying to reverse engineer the
divoom pixoo max protocol to display images and animation. It is an absolute
work in progress. Currently it can only set static images.

Even though it is far from being a nice library ready to be used, it may still
be useful to some of you out there. Therefore it is published without any
guarantees. I might create a proper library of this in the future or not.
I really don't know yet. Please don't blame me if this experiment just stays
an experiment and gets abandoned by myself :).

Nevertheless, if you are using this as a starting point for further reverse
engineering or implementation pull requests are very welcome.
